A few months ago, when I first tried Pi - an AI chatbot made by Inflection AI - I was amazed at how natural the chatbot could be. At that time, Pi was much different and simpler, and it has improved a lot, quickly.

It can maintain very human-like conversations, and I absolutely love the design. I really like the simplicity of it. It's mid at maths, great and at brainstorming, but it outperforms all other chatbots in being conversational and human-like.

Comparing it to other popular AI chatbots like Perplexity, ChatGPT, or Bard, while they can be better at some features, they still lack the naturality of Pi (yeah, the name isn't great...). I wish it could cite sources thought.

It also seems that Pi is built on a proprietary large language model developed and trained by Inflection AI entirely in-house. According to Inflection AI, "Pi doesn’t use any third-party language model APIs".

Another great feature is the audio option. The voices sound amazing, with all the pauses needed, and honestly, I think they outperform all others. It is obviously still in development, with essential features like a way to clear chat, edit prompts, regenerate responses, etc., but I actually think it's great!

I also like that it can switch the "model" that the conversation is using - "Pi" and "SupportPi" - clearly there are more to come.

According to [this document](https://inflection.ai/assets/Inflection-1.pdf) released by Inflection AI, *"Inflection-1 (the model used by pi) is the best model in its compute class, outperforming GPT-3.5, LLaMA, Chinchilla, and PaLM-540B"*:

> *On trivia style question answering, our model outperforms LLaMA by a considerable margin and is competitive with Google's recent flagship model, PaLM 2-L. For TriviaQA, we show two different evaluation splits allowing us to compare to LLaMA, Chinchilla, and PaLM.*

Inflection AI also seems to be [working on an API](https://inflection.ai/company#api), available soon.
