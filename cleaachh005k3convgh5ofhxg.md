# Websockets: Real-Time updates

Real-time updates are a must-have feature in many modern web applications. From chat applications to online marketplaces, providing users with the ability to receive immediate updates is crucial to creating a seamless experience.

One way to implement real-time updates in a web application is by using WebSockets. WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel between the client and server, allowing for real-time data transfer in both directions. In this article, we'll go over how to use WebSockets to implement real-time updates in a web application.

1. ### Getting started with websockets
    

To get started with WebSockets, you'll need to use a WebSockets library, such as `socket.io` for Node.js or `Pusher` for PHP. These libraries provide a convenient API for working with WebSockets, making it easy to get up and running quickly.

1. ### Setting Up the Server
    

To set up the server for WebSockets, you'll need to create a WebSockets endpoint and configure the server to listen for WebSockets connections. The following code sets up a WebSockets endpoint using Socket.io in Node.js:

```javascript
const io = require("socket.io")(server);

io.on("connection", socket => {
  console.log("A user connected");
});
```

This code sets up a WebSockets endpoint using the socket.io library and listens for connections. When a user connects, the code logs a message to the console.

1. ### Setting Up the Client
    

Next, you'll need to set up the client to connect to the WebSockets endpoint. The following code sets up a WebSockets connection using it in the browser:

```javascript
const socket = io();

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to the server");
});
```

This code sets up a WebSockets connection to the server and listens for the `connect` event. When the client successfully connects to the server, the code logs a message to the console.

1. ### Sending and Receiving Messages
    

With the server and client set up, you can now send and receive messages over the WebSockets connection. The following code sends a message from the client to the server:

```javascript
socket.emit("newMessage", { text: "Hello, World!" });
```

And the following code receives the message on the server:

```javascript
io.on("newMessage", data => {
  console.log("Received message:", data);
});
```

This code sends a message from the client to the server using the `emit` method, and the server receives the message using the `on` method. When the server receives the message, it logs the data to the console.
