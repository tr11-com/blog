If you have been reading my blog from the beginning, you should remember the article ["Getting started with Hashnode Rix"](https://blog.tiagorangel.com/getting-started-with-hashnode-rix), that I posted some time ago.

Rix sounded interesting, but now it has got a new redesign.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687514438875/327b6ff5-6caa-4e42-bd33-3a6cb73b0d2b.png align="center")

It has now got a totally new interface. On the dropdown inside the search box, you can select 3 options:

* Web Search
    
* Quick Mode, and
    
* Code Writer
    

Web Search mode is capable of searching the web, while Quick mode is the standard one, and Code Writer is better at writing code.

You can also provide a link to Web Search mode and it will instantly summarize the webpage.

You can also now share a thread, just like this: [https://hashnode.com/rix/64956dddddccb22bfd00b100](https://hashnode.com/rix/64956dddddccb22bfd00b100).
