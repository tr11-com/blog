# Making my BETA website design

**Step 1. Font selection**

To begin this project, I carefully selected two fonts: Playfair Display and Inter, which I felt captured the modern and beautiful aesthetic I desired for the beta redesign.

**Step 2. Prototype in Figma**

After that, I started making a prototype in Figma with a design that was clear, organized, and fast.  
The results were satisfactory, and I liked the design. The prototype website featured my logo in a small font at the top, a header, a description, projects with a “Show More” button (a significant upgrade from the original website), and a slider with social links (another significant upgrade).

Wow, for me looks nice! Now, the most difficult part: make it work. As usual, I coded everything on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/): It's a nice interface, with autosave, and HTTPS domains, and works fast.

After working some time creating the initial preview with Glitch, I got an honestly nice result:

I was quite happy with the result. [Splide](https://splidejs.com/) worked well with the slider: some small customization and I was good to go.

**Step 3. Make it work**

I added multiple things to actually *make the website work*:

* I added a title animation (the one saying "Howdy"). [Moving letters](https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/) provided some outstanding ones, and were easy to integrate. I decided to go with *#7*. I also added a waving hand APNG from emojipedia.
    
* I also added a language picker
    
* I connected my spreadsheet with data to the website ([see this post](https://blog.tiagorangel.com/connecting-my-website-with-google-sheets))
    
* I also added much more features and *I am* adding more features, so [check out my website](https://tiagorangel.com/)!
