Dealing with Windows can be a frustrating experience, as I recently found out. I was happily reading a blog post when, suddenly, my mouse stopped working, my screen went black, and my computer restarted. Without me doing anything, it was "Updating Windows... 20% Done!" As a result, my unsaved work was lost in the process, and my computer's performance seemed to have been affected as well (I have heard of Windows slowing down your computer after updates, but not like this!).

What's worse, there was no warning that this was about to occur. This serves as a reminder to always save your work in case Windows decides to do its own thing. It's a lesson I won't soon forget!
