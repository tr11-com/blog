# Why to switch to duckduckgo

Are you tired of being tracked by big tech companies every time you search for something online? Are you fed up with targeted ads following you around the internet? Well, it's time to ditch Google and make the switch to Duckduckgo - the privacy-focused search engine that puts you in control of your online experience.

Still not convinced? Here are 7 reasons why you should switch to Duckduckgo:

1. ### Your searches are private
    

When you use Google, every search query you make is logged and analyzed to build a profile of you. This profile is then used to serve you **targeted ads and recommendations**. With Duckduckgo, your searches are completely private. They don't track you, store your data or sell it to advertisers. It's like having a secret search engine just for you.

1. ### No filter bubble
    

Google's search results are tailored to you based on your browsing history, location, and other data they have on you. **This means you only see what they *think* you want to see.** Duckduckgo, on the other hand, shows you the same results as everyone else. This means you get a more objective view of the world, free from the "filter bubble".

1. ### Instant answers
    

Duckduckgo has a feature called "Instant Answers" that provides answers to your queries right on the search results page. For example, if you search for ["minify JS"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=minify+JS&atb=v358-1&ia=answer#:~:text=Defini%C3%A7%C3%B5es-,Minifier,-Enter%20code%20below) it will instantly show you a box to minify your code on the top. No need to click through to another website.

1. ### Bangs!
    

One of the coolest features of Duckduckgo is "Bangs!". This allows you to search other websites directly from the Duckduckgo search box. For example, if you want to search for a product on Amazon, just type `!a` followed by your search query. Prefer Wikipedia? Use `!w`. There is actually a bang for everything! Bangs are a real time-saver.

1. ### Customizable interface
    

Duckduckgo lets you customize the look and feel of the search engine. You can change the background, theme, URL style, and much more. It's a small thing, but it makes the search engine feel more personal.

1. ### No more annoying ads
    

Have you ever searched for something on Google and then seen ads for that product follow you around the internet? It's creepy and annoying. With Duckduckgo, you don't have to worry about targeted ads. They don't track you, remember?

1. ### It's just better
    

Duckduckgo is just a better search engine. It's fast, reliable, and provides great search results. Plus, you get all the privacy benefits we've already talked about.
