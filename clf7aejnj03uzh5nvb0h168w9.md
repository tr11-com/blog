Web development platforms have revolutionized the way developers create and deploy web applications. But with so many options out there, it can be overwhelming to choose the right platform for your needs. That's why I've done the hard work for you and compared the most popular web development platforms available today.

1. **Vercel**
    

Vercel is a powerful platform that offers automatic scaling and instant deployment. Its advanced features make it an excellent choice for building complex projects. And they have a nice UI! üòé

But Vercel can be somewhat difficult to use compared to Replit or other competitors.

1. **Netlify**
    

Netlify is a feature-rich platform that offers continuous deployment and form handling for free. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy for developers to deploy and manage their projects.

However, some users have reported issues with site speed, and its pricing plans can get expensive for advanced features.

1. **Replit**
    

Replit is a great platform that offers collaborative coding and real-time editing for free. Its community-driven approach and focus on education make it an excellent choice for students and beginner developers, altought its user interface can be a bit overwhelming for some users, the domains are really limited (projectname.username.repl.co, before it was only projectname.repl.co - clear downgrade) and it is sometimes a bit slow.

1. **Glitch**
    

Glitch is a popular platform that offers hosting for full-stack JavaScript apps and collaborative coding for free. Its simple user interface and active community make it easy for beginners to get started. It also has some basic real-time capabilities, good domains (yourproject.glitch.me), this time really INSTANT deploys (~1 second to update the full website), and more. However, Glitch's features are somewhat limited compared to other platforms.

1. **GitHub Pages**
    

GitHub Pages is a basic platform that offers free hosting for static websites. It's a good choice for developers who want a simple way to host their projects, but GitHub Pages don't offer much in terms of customization or dynamic content. Also, their domain is bad. yourusername.github.io/yourproject/page?

So, which platform should you choose? It depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you're a beginner, Glitch or Replit might be the best fit. If you're building a complex project, Vercel or Netlify might be a better choice. Although, out of all options, I prefer Glitch.
