Web development platforms have revolutionized the way developers create and deploy web applications. But with so many options out there, it can be overwhelming to choose the right platform for your needs. That's why we've done the hard work for you and compared the most popular web development platforms available today.

1. **Vercel**
    

Vercel is a powerful platform that offers automatic scaling and instant deployment. Its advanced features make it an excellent choice for building complex projects. However, Vercel can be a bit pricey for some users, and because it uses GitHub or a provider as a start it can not be the best option if you only want to create a small project right away.

1. **Netlify**
    

Netlify is a feature-rich platform that offers continuous deployment and form handling for free. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy for developers to deploy and manage their projects. However, some users have reported issues with site speed, and its pricing plans can get expensive for advanced features.

1. **Replit**
    

Replit is a great platform that offers collaborative coding and real-time editing for free. Its community-driven approach and focus on education make it an excellent choice for students and beginner developers. However, its user interface can be a bit overwhelming for some users, the domains are really limited (projectname.username.repl.co) and it is sometimes a bit slow.

1. **Glitch**
    

Glitch is a popular platform that offers hosting for full-stack JavaScript apps and collaborative coding for free. Its simple user interface and active community make it easy for beginners to get started. It also has some basic real-time capabilities, good domains (yourproject.glitch.me) and more. However, Glitch's features are limited compared to other platforms, and its customization options are limited.

1. **GitHub Pages**
    

GitHub Pages is a basic platform that offers free hosting for static websites. It's a good choice for developers who want a simple way to host their projects. However, GitHub Pages doesn't offer much in terms of customization or dynamic content.

Also, github page's domain is bad. yourusername.github.io/yourproject/page?

So, which platform should you choose? It depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you're a beginner, Glitch or Replit might be the best fit. If you're building a complex project, Vercel or Netlify might be a better choice.
