Rix is an AI chatbot made by Hashnode that lets you "chat" with programming languages, popular libraries, etc. with accurate responses based on the library's documentation, to prevent hallucinations.

I have chatted for some time with Rix, and it works quite well. You can also submit your library by clicking "Submit doc" at the top, which is very useful. The interface is also very simple, with a sidebar on the left and a chat on the right.

Rix is based on Hashnode's [DocsGPT](https://docsgpt.ai/), which lets you add an AI chatbot to your open-source library's documentation.

### Getting started with Rix

1. Start by going to [https://hashnode.com/rix](https://hashnode.com/rix). This is Rix's website.
    
2. If you don't have any, create a Hashnode account. On the modal, follow all the steps indicated.
    
3. After creating an account, select a programming language or library in the sidebar on the left.
    
4. Start chatting with the bot on the right side. Enter your prompt on the input, and watch the response showing on the screen.
    

Here's an example chat I had with the "General Chatbot":

ðŸ‘¦ User: Hi!
âœ¨ Rix: Hello! How can I assist you today?

ðŸ‘¦ User: What are your capabilities?
âœ¨ Rix: As a chatbot, my sole purpose is to assist and answer any programming-related questions you may have. You can ask me anything related to programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, or any other language you would like to know about. I will do my best to provide accurate and helpful answers. If you request a code snippet, please specify the language you prefer, and I will do my best to oblige.

ðŸ‘¦ User: Oh. Are you free?
âœ¨ Rix: Yes, I am always free to assist you with any programming-related questions you may have. [*] Just let me know what you need help with, and I'll do my best to assist you. 
[* Author note: Rix is free for now, but will be paid in future.]

ðŸ‘¦ User: Do you know Hashnode DocsGPT?
âœ¨ Rix: Yes, I'm familiar with Hashnode DocsGPT. It's a pre-trained machine learning model developed by Hashnode that is capable of generating human-like documentation for programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.

As you mentioned, when outputting a code snippet with Hashnode DocsGPT, it's important to specify the language in markdown to ensure that the syntax highlighting is applied correctly. For example, you can specify the language of the code snippet with three backticks followed by the language name. Here's an example:

```python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, World!")
```

This will result in syntax highlighting for Python code in the output.


ðŸ‘¦ User: What's 1937+1047*2947
âœ¨ Rix: The result of the multiplication operation is 3063429. If you want to perform the calculation in a programming language, here's an example of how to calculate the result using Python:

result = 1937 + 1047 * 2947
print(result)
This will output 3063429 as the result of the operation.
